        As a first step, you need to unlock the bootloader. A bootloader is the piece of software, that tells your phone
        how to start and run an operating system (like Android). Your device should be turned on.
        Click on the button to open the instructions on the Fairphone Support official unlocking website to generate an unlock code for your device.
        Once you've done that, continue.

        Press 'Confirm and run' to reboot into the bootloader.

        In this step you actually unlock the bootloader. Just press 'Confirm and run' here. Once it's done, press continue here.

        After the phone reboots, boot into the fastboot mode once again by pressing 'Confirm and run' here. Then continue.
      command: adb_reboot_bootloader

        When you are in fastboot mode again, you need to run another unlock step here.

        To finish the unlocking, the phone needs to reboot. Just press 'Confirm and run' here to reboot. Then continue.
      command: fastboot_reboot
    - type: confirm_button

        The bootloader is now unlocked. Since the device resets completely, you will need to re-enable USB debugging to continue.
  boot_recovery:
    - type: confirm_button
      content: >
        Now you need to boot a custom recovery system on the phone. A recovery is a small subsystem on your phone, that manages updating,
        adapting and repairing of the operating system.
