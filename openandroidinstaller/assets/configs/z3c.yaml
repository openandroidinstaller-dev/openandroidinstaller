        As a first step, you need to unlock the bootloader of your device. On the device, dial *#*#7378423#*#* (*#*#SERVICE#*#*) to launch the service menu.
    - type: confirm_button

        Go to service info > configuration and check rooting status - you can only continue if it says 'Bootloader unlock allowed":" Yes.'
    - type: confirm_button

        Now go to Settings 'About the phone' and then Status. Write down the IMEI of your device. You will need it in the next step.

        Click on the button to open the instructions on Sonys official unlocking website to generate an unlock code for your bootloader.
