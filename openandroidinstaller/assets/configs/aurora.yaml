  unlock_bootloader:
    - type: confirm_button
      content: >
        As a first step, you need to unlock the bootloader of your device. On the device, dial *#*#7378423#*#* (*#*#SERVICE#*#*) to launch the service menu.
    - type: confirm_button
      content: >
        Go to service info > configuration and check rooting status - you can only continue if it says 'Bootloader unlock allowed":" Yes.'
    - type: confirm_button
      content: >
        Now go to Settings 'About the phone' and then Status. Write down the IMEI of your device. You will need it in the next step.
    - type: link_button_with_confirm
      content: >
        Click on the button to open the instructions on Sonys official unlocking website to generate an unlock code for your bootloader.
        Once you got the code write it down somewhere and continue to input the code.

    - type: confirm_button
      content: >
        Connect the device to your PC via USB. And confirm to continue.
    - type: call_button
      content: >
        Press the button to reboot into the bootloader now. When the notification light turns blue, confirm to continue.
      command: adb_reboot_bootloader
    - type: call_button_with_input
      content: >
        Use your code to unlock the bootloader of your device. Type in the full 18 character code starting with 0x (Example: 0x3EC4F7AD6E0B32B6).
        If you already did that, you can skip this step.
      command: fastboot_unlock_with_code
    - type: call_button
      content: >
        Press the button to reboot. Since the device resets completely, you will need to re-enable USB debugging to continue.
        Connect your device to your PC via USB. Then confirm here to continue.
      command: fastboot_reboot
  boot_recovery:
    - type: call_button
      content: >
        Now you need to boot a custom recovery system on the phone. A recovery is a small subsystem on your phone, that manages updating,
        adapting and repairing of the operating system.
        Make sure your device is turned on. You need to reboot into the bootloader again by pressing 'Confirm and run' here. Then continue.
      command: adb_reboot_bootloader
    - type: call_button
      content: >
        Boot a custom recovery (temporarily) by pressing 'Confirm and run'. Once it's done continue.
      command: fastboot_flash_boot
    - type: call_button
      content: >
        In some cases, the inactive slot can be unpopulated or contain much older firmware than the active slot, leading to various issues including a potential hard-brick.
        We can ensure none of that will happen by copying the contents of the active slot to the inactive slot. Press 'confirm and run' to to this. Once you are in the bootloader again, continue.
      command: adb_twrp_copy_partitions
    - type: call_button
      content: >
        Now we need to boot into recovery again. Press run and when you see the TWRP screen you can continue.
      command: fastboot_flash_boot
