        As a first step, you need to boot into the bootloader. A bootloader is the piece of software,
        that tells your phone who to start and run an operating system (like Android). Your device should be turned on.
        Then press 'Confirm and run' to reboot into the bootloader. Continue once it's done.
      command: adb_reboot_download
    - type: call_button

        In this step, you need to flash a custom recovery on your device.
        Press 'Confirm and run' to start the process. Confirm afterwards to continue.

        Unplug the USB cable from your device. Then manually reboot into recovery by pressing the *Volume Down* + *Power buttons* for 
        8~10 seconds until the screen turns black & release the buttons immediately when it does, then boot to recovery with the device powered off, 
        hold *Volume Up* + *Home* + *Power*. Confirm when the recovery screen appears.
  install_os:
    - type: call_button

        In the next steps, you finally flash the selected OS image.
        Connect your device with your computer with the USB-Cable.
        This step will format your phone and wipe all the data. It will also remove encryption and delete all files stored 
        in the internal storage. Then the OS image will be installed. Confirm to run. This might take a while. At the end your phone will boot into the new OS.
