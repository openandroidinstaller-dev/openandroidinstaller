steps:
  unlock_bootloader:
    - type: call_button

        As a first step, you need to unlock the bootloader. A bootloader is the piece of software, that tells your phone
        how to start and run an operating system (like Android). Your device should be turned on.
        Press 'Confirm and run' to reboot into the bootloader.
      command: adb_reboot_bootloader
    - type: call_button
      content: >
        In this step you actually unlock the bootloader. Just press 'Confirm and run' here. The phone will automatically reboot and reformat.
        Once it's done, press continue here.

        Notice: If you don't have the stock OnePlus One recovery, your device might boot into your custom recovery, but don't do anything / throw an error.
        If this appears, reboot you device through your bootloader and just continue normally. (Your bootloader will be unlocked.)
      command: fastboot_oem_unlock
    - type: confirm_button
      content: >
        The bootloader is now unlocked. Since the device resets completely, you will need to re-enable Developer Options and USB debugging to continue.
        You don't need to re-enable those options, if you have a custom recovery. (See last step.)
        When you are done, press continue.
  boot_recovery:
    - type: call_button
      content: >
        Now you need to boot a custom recovery system on the phone. A recovery is a small subsystem on your phone, that manages updating,
        adapting and repairing of the operating system.
        Make sure your device is turned on. You need to reboot into the bootloader again by pressing 'Confirm and run' here. Then continue.
      command: adb_reboot_bootloader
    - type: call_button

        Boot a custom recovery (temporarily) by pressing 'Confirm and run'. Once it's done continue.
      command: fastboot_boot_recovery
