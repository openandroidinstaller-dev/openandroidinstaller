        As a first step, you need to boot into the bootloader. A bootloader is the piece of software, 
        that tells your phone who to start and run an operating system (like Android). Your device should be turned on. 
        Then press 'Confirm and run' to reboot into the bootloader. Continue once it's done.
      command: adb_reboot_download
    - type: call_button
      content: In this step, you need to boot a custom recovery on your device. Press 'Confirm and run' to start the process. Confirm afterwards to continue.
      command: heimdall_flash_recovery
    - type: confirm_button

        Unplug the USB cable from your device. Then manually reboot into recovery by pressing the *Volume Down* + *Power buttons* for 8~10 seconds 
        until the screen turns black & release the buttons immediately when it does, then boot to recovery with the device powered off, 
        hold *Volume Up* + *Home* + *Power button*.
