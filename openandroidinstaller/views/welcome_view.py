The following steps are performed in this tool:
- First, we help you to **get your device ready** for the installation process.
- Next, you can **select the operating system** you want to install (with guidance).
- Then, we guide you though the process of **unlocking the bootloader** (if necessary). If you don't know what that means, it will be explained later.
- As a next step, the **operation system is installed**. At this point you can also **select to install additional software** ("addons") like Google Apps.
- Finally your device starts your new operating system.
