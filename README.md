    The OpenAndroidInstaller project helps Android users to keep their smartphone's operating system up to date with free software and to continue using the device even though the manufacturer no longer offers updates. With a graphical installation software, users are easily guided through the installation process of free Android operating systems like <a href="https://lineageos.org">LineageOS</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> This application is currently in beta state, so use at your own risk! While many people tested the application so far and we heard of no bricked devices, things might still go wrong.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Unlocking the bootloader will erase all data on your device!**
> This also includes your DRM keys, which are stored in the Trim Area partition (also called TA) in case your device is fairly recent and supports DRM L1. Those devices will be downgraded to DRM L3. Devices on DRM L3 by default will not be affected.
> Depending on your device you might be able to back up the TA partition using exploits and gaining temporary root access. On Sony Xperia 1/5 series phones DRM L1 will return once the bootloader is relocked.
> Before proceeding, ensure the data you would like to retain is backed up to your PC and/or your Google account, or equivalent. Please note that OEM backup solutions like Samsung and Motorola backup may not be accessible from LineageOS once installed.

## Usage

Linux is currently the best supported platform (tested with Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS). Windows and macOS are also supported, but you might experience more issues.

### 1. Download OpenAndroidInstaller

> [!WARNING]
> ARM-based systems are **not supported**.

OpenAndroidInstaller support all three major operating systems, namely Linux, macOS and Windows.
You can download the correct version for you system from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/openandroidinstaller-dev/openandroidinstaller/releases/latest).

The executables are compressed inside `.zip` files, so you'll have to extract them first (make sure you have extracting software installed).
If you get prompted to, you'll have to adjust the permission of the executable to ensure its proper functionality.

If you run Windows, you might also need to [install the Universal USB Drivers](https://adb.clockworkmod.com) and other potentially drivers needed for your device.

For Linux, a Flatpak version is available in Flathub, [`org.openandroidinstaller.OpenAndroidInstaller`](https://flathub.org/apps/org.openandroidinstaller.OpenAndroidInstaller).

### 2. Download the custom ROM, recovery image & optional add-ons

Here are the official links for:

  - some custom ROMs:
    - [BlissRoms](https://blissroms.org)
    - [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org)
    - [/e/OS](https://doc.e.foundation/devices)
    - [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org)
    - [LineageOS](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices)
    - [LineageOS for MicroG](https://download.lineage.microg.org)
  - Recovery:
    - [TWRP recovery](https://twrp.me/Devices)
  - Optional Add-ons:
    - There are different packages of *Google Apps* available:
      - [MindTheGapps](https://wiki.lineageos.org/gapps#downloads)
      - [NikGApps](https://nikgapps.com)
    - [MicroG](https://microg.org)
      - The recommended way to install MicroG is from the `.zip` file provided here: [`MinMicroG-abuse-CI/releases`](https://github.com/FriendlyNeighborhoodShane/MinMicroG-abuse-CI/releases).
    - [F-Droid App-Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged.ota).
  - or you can just search the web or the [XDA Developers forum](https://xdaforums.com) to find an appropriate version for your device.

### 3. Start OpenAndroidInstaller

After starting the app you will be prompted to plug your device into your computer and you will be given a step-by-step tutorial on how to install your new OS for your specific device.
