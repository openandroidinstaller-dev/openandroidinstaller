  <p>
    The OpenAndroidInstaller project helps Android users to keep their smartphone's operating system up to date with free software and to continue using the device even though the manufacturer no longer offers updates. With a graphical installation software, users are easily guided through the installation process of free Android operating systems like <a href="https://lineageos.org">LineageOS</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> This application is currently in beta state, so use at your own risk! While many people tested the application so far and we heard of no bricked devices, things might still go wrong.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unlocking the bootloader will erase all data on your device!
> This also includes your DRM keys, which are stored in the Trim Area partition (also called TA) in case your device is fairly recent and supports DRM L1. Those devices will be downgraded to DRM L3. Devices on DRM L3 by default will not be affected.
> Before proceeding, ensure the data you would like to retain is backed up to your PC and/or your Google account, or equivalent. Please note that OEM backup solutions like Samsung and Motorola backup may not be accessible from LineageOS once installed.
> If you wish to backup the TA partition first, you can find tutorials related to your device on the internet.

## Usage

Linux is currently the best supported platform (tested with Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS). Windows and macOS are also supported but you might experience more issues. So far there is no support for ARM-based systems.

1. Download the [.exe or appropriate executable file for your OS](https://github.com/openandroidinstaller-dev/openandroidinstaller/releases) from the releases or get the [official flatpak from flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.openandroidinstaller.OpenAndroidInstaller). You might need to change permissions to run the executable.
    - On Windows also [install the Universal USB Drivers](https://adb.clockworkmod.com) and other potentially drivers needed for your device.
2. Download the custom ROM image and the TWRP recovery image for your device and optionally some addons. A source for files can be found on the following websites:
    - some custom ROMs:
      - [LineageOS](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices)
      - [/e/OS](https://doc.e.foundation/devices)
      - [LineageOS for microg](https://download.lineage.microg.org)
      - [BlissRoms](https://blissroms.org)
      - [PixelExperience](https://download.pixelexperience.org)
    - TWRP Recovery:
      - [TWRP recovery](https://twrp.me/Devices)
    - Optional Addons:
      - There are different packages of *Google Apps* available.
        - [MindTheGapps](https://wiki.lineageos.org/gapps#downloads)
        - [NikGApps](https://nikgapps.com)
      - [MicroG](https://microg.org)
        - The recommended way to install MicroG is to use the zip file provided here: [https://github.com/FriendlyNeighborhoodShane/MinMicroG-abuse-CI/releases](https://github.com/FriendlyNeighborhoodShane/MinMicroG-abuse-CI/releases).
      - [F-Droid App-Store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged.ota).
    - or you can just search the web or the [xda-developers forum](https://xdaforums.com) for an appropriate version for your device.
3. Start the desktop app and follow the instructions.

## Officially supported devices

Currently, the **we support 74 devices** by various vendors and working on adding more soon!

Support for these devices is provided as best effort, but things might still go wrong.
Help to improve the tool by reporting any issues you might face.
