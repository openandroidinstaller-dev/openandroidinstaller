# On unlocking the bootloader

> [!IMPORTANT]
> First of all, this tool will not help you bypass any vender locked bootloaders in non-official ways.

Devices by *Samsung, Google, OnePlus, Fairphone* and others make it relatively easy to unlock the bootloader and get good support in the installer.

For some devices, it is necessary to unlock the bootloader manually. You usually need to create an account on the manufacturer's website, wait for a certain time and obtain a code from there. OpenAndroidInstaller will try to guide you as far as possible. These vendors include *Sony, Motorola and Xiaomi* amongst others.

Other phone manufacturers no longer allow you to unlock the bootloader. Nothing can be done if you have not unlocked your device in time. These manufacturers include *Huawei, Honor, LG and ASUS*. Support for these manufacturers will always be very limited.
